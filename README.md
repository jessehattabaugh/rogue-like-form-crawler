# ✨ Rogue-like Form Crawler ✨

Welcome to the labyrinthine depths of the web—where every checkbox conceals a secret, every submit button is a leap of faith, and each form might please (or displease) the inscrutable deity behind your screen.

In this rogue-like form crawler, you'll navigate a procedurally-generated maze of seemingly mundane yet oddly compelling web forms. Some buttons lie, promising progress but secretly stealing your strength. Others pulse ominously, hinting at hidden connections or concealed traps. Your choices shape your destiny—and possibly please a mysterious digital entity with unknown intentions.

Collect obscure items, manage your inventory wisely, and decipher the cryptic patterns woven into the HTML itself. Solve ever-evolving puzzles, unravel hidden rules, and discover clandestine ways to manipulate forms to your advantage. But beware: forms evolve over time—changing hourly, nightly, even seasonally. Late-night forms offer different mysteries than those at dawn, and special forms only appear under precise conditions.

Can you master the form maze, exploit its complexities, and emerge victorious? Or will you succumb to poisoned buttons, deceptive sliders, and occult checkboxes designed to ensnare?

⚠️ **Proceed with caution—your next click could change everything.**
