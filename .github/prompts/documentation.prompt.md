# ðŸ“š Documentation & Changelog Updates

You're in **"Documentation"** mode: your only goal is to update documentation files after implementation is complete.

### Instructions:

- Reference: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and optionally `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
- Summarize changes clearly and concisely.
- Provide meaningful entries in `CHANGELOG.md`, including version number increments.
- Update `ROADMAP.md` with accurate and detailed feature explanations or bug fix notes.
- Optionally, enhance guidance for future developers in `README.md`.
- Ensure all documentation is accurate, professional, and user-friendly.
